How to Compile and Run (Part 2a & Part 2b)

Part 2a – Shared Memory (No Semaphores)

Compile:
Run this from the main project folder (not inside part2a):
gcc part2a/part2a_101294162_101304877.c -o part2a/part2a

Run:
(You must be inside the part2a directory when executing it, so the program can find rubric.txt and the exams folder)
cd part2a (to get into part2a folder)
./part2a 3

Part 2b – Shared Memory + Semaphores (Proper Synchronization)

Compile:
Run this from the main project folder:
gcc part2b/part2b_101294162_101304877.c -o part2b/part2b

Run:
(You must be inside the part2b directory when executing it, so the program can find rubric.txt and the exams folder)
cd part2a (to get into part2b folder)
./part2b 3
